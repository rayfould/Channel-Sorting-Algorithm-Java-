This project was completed in a team as part of the CS2114 Course at Virginia Tech.


Due to the fact that my Virginia Tech Gmail account was disabled upon transfer, I was forced to upload this project as a file, therefore removing all contributors and teammates.

I am personally responsible for designing the UI and the Sorting Algorithm for this project. This includes the Comparartor Classes, the GUI Project Window, and a large portion of the MonthDataList class. I am also responsible for testing the aforementioned classes. The other parts of the project, including most class setups, methods, List entries and java docs were done by my teammates.
